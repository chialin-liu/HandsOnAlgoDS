406. Minimum Size Subarray Sum


Description


Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return -1 instead.

Have you met this question in a real interview?  

Example

Example 1:

Input: [2,3,1,2,4,3], s = 7

Output: 2

Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Example 2:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], s = 100

Output: -1

Challenge

If you have figured out the O(nlog n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n).
